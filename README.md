# kaunas_coding_oct-nov
another school project

In this school project I mostly focused on understanding back end in php,
so it only contains couple of javascript functions for form validations and such.
I managed to achieve my goal of transfering multiple datasets without changing the design much
and reusing as much components as possible.
